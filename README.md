# siesta
SIESTA is both a method and its computer program implementation, to perform efficient electronic structure calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of molecules and solids.

This project seeks to make a simple, intuitive installer for the siesta 4.0 software, as well as provide improved documentation for Linux & Unix platforms.
